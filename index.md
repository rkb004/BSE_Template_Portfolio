# Third eye for the Blind
I am working on a wearable device for the blind that uses ultrasonic waves to detect obstacles. The device notifies the user through vibrations and buzzers sounds.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone


My first milestone was setting up the ultrasonic sensor and connecting it with the buzzer. As I moved my hand closer to the device, the buzzer started going off which is important because the device needs to help blind people become aware of their surroundings.

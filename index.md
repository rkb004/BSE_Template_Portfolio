# Third eye for the Blind
I am working on a wearable device for the blind that uses ultrasonic waves to detect obstacles. The device notifies the user through vibrations and buzzers sounds.

My first milestone was setting up the ultrasonic sensor and connecting it with the buzzer. In the video, I moved my hand towards the ultrasonic sensor to demonstrate how it uses the buzzer the inform whoever is wearing the device that an object is nearby. The purpose of this device is to help blind people navigate through the world a little easier. According to WHO, there are over 40 million blind people in the world, and this device can make their life a little easier.
